Gephex examples
georg

<a href="http://www.gephex.org/go.php?url=http://demos.314r.net/gephex/">This site</a> has a lot of good examples for Gephex, both elementary and advanced, and some nice videos that go with them.

The example graphs demonstrate how to use sound to control various effects, how to play videos at different speeds, how to generate sound with Gephex and much more. The graphs are documented in french and in english. Have fun!
