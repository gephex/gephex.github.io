Roadmap
georg

It has been some time since this page was updated, so I thought it might
be good to send out some signs of life.

Our next release will be 0.4 - that's quite a jump from 0.0.4.
It seems that some people have been irritated by our, hm,
 somewhat conservative versioning practice.

Version 0.4 will contain several small bug fixes, some code cleanup,
and an improved v4l module.

After that, we will concentrate on our rewrite, which will start with
version 0.5. Highlights of gephex-0.5 will be:

<ul>
<li> a better plugin architecture (allowing
to group several effects into one shared library,<br/>
providing complete compiler independence<br/>
and better support for plugins written in C++)</li>
<li> a new GUI (redesigned from scratch and focused on live performances) </li>
<li> improved stability </li>
<li> scripting support </li>
<li> <a href="http://www.freeframe.org/">freeframe</a> plugin support </li>
</ul>

You can expect the 0.4 release in the next two months.

The 0.5 release will take a little longer.
