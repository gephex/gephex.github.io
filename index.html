    <h1>What is Gephex?</h1>

    <p>Gephex is a modular video jockey software. The base visuals can be 
    chosen from sources like video files or cameras. Then they can be modified 
    by filters and mixers. Each modifier has several parameters, that can be 
    controlled by signal-generators, input devices like joysticks, sound cards,
     or midi-devices.</p>

    <p>Gephex runs on GNU/Linux, Win32, Mac OS X, and FreeBSD.
    The effect engine is independent from the user 
    interface, which can be de- and attached at runtime. All effects and media 
    streams are extendible by plugins. Gephex is written in C++.</p>
