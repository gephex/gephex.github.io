problems with libavifile [update]
georg

The new libavifile package (0.7.38.20030710-1.1) in debian unstable does not
work with gephex. We don't know the exact reasons yet, see this
<a href="http://news.gmane.org/find-root.php?group=gmane.comp.video.gephex.devel&amp;article=94"> thread</a> for details.

As a temporary fix, we have added the old libavifile package
(0.7.38.20030710-1) to our apt-server and have uploaded a new version
of the gephex package that has a dependency against this package.

Users of unstable will have to install the old version of libavifile
and tell apt to hold this version. Sorry for the inconvinience.

In Debian Sarge (testing), there is no avifile package included.
If you install the avifile packages (0.7.38.20030710-sarge1) from
"deb ftp://ftp.nerim.net/debian-marillat/ testing main", video playback
with gephex works. 

<a href="http://www.gephex.org/go.php?url=http://ffmpeg.sf.net">ffmpeg</a>
support for the gephex-0.4 branch is currently being worked on, and it will
replace libavifile to avoid this strange bug.
We will release gephex-0.4.1 as soon as it is stable.
