frei0r, a minimalistic video effect API, has been
<a href="http://www.piksel.org/Frei0r/">released</a> recently.
We are currently porting most of our filters to this new API.

This might be interesting for people that have thought about
writing effects for gephex but who were put off by our rather
complex internal API.

gephex-0.4.1 does not support frei0r effects, but gephex-0.4.2,
which will be released soon, will support it (for the impatient:
it is already in our 
<a href="http://arch.gephex.org/gephex/2004/gephex/">arch</a> repository).
