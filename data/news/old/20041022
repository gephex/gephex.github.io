Third pre-release for gephex-0.4.1 released
georg

The third pre-release for 0.4.1 is ready for download.
I have built a dist from
gephex@gephex.org--2004/gephex--release--0.4.1--base-0
.

The sources are located <a href="http://www.gephex.org/download/src/gephex-0.4.1pre3.tar.bz2">here</a>.

The <a href="http://www.gephex.org/download/win32/gephex-0.4.1pre3.rar">win32 binary</a> release is not uploaded yet, but will be available sometime today.

Most important changes since the last pre-release:
<ul>
 <li> ffmpeg output (only works on linux, on win32 it causes
      an access violation) </li>
 <li> yuv4mpeg input </li>
 <li> noise module, yuv4mpeg output and input are now also available
      on win32 </li>
 <li> fixed two bugs in the win32 joystickdriver (not tested yet) </li>
 <li> support for command-line parameters in engine and gui</li>
</ul>

Please note that the new yuv4mpeg input and output, and the
ffmpeg output are still experimental.

Looking forward to your bug reports (or success stories)!
