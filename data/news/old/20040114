CVS moved from sourceforge
georg

Today we deactivated our CVS repository at sourceforge.
Until we have set up cvs access on gephex.org, you can get the latest
cvs snapshot from the <a href="http://www.gephex.org/download.php">download</a>
page.

For more details see also this <a href="http://lists.gephex.org/pipermail/gephex-devel/2004-January/000011.html">message</a> in the gephex-devel mailinglist.
